# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake Game developed using the Pygame library in Python. The game involves a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the screen boundaries.

## Features

- Control the snake using arrow keys.
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen edges.
- Option to restart the game after losing.

## Installation

To run the Snake Game, you need to have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## How to Play

1. Run the `snake_game.py` file to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
3. Eat the green food blocks to grow longer.
4. Avoid running into the screen boundaries or the snake's own body.
5. If you lose, press 'C' to play again or 'Q' to quit.

## Saving the Game

The game code is saved in the `./evaluate/examples/` directory as `snake_game.py`.
