"\nDescription: Create a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all even numbers in the list.\nExpected Output: A Python function that correctly sums all even numbers in a given list.\n"
"\nDescription: Write a function that accepts a string and returns the string reversed, but only if the string length is greater than 5 characters. Otherwise, return the original string.\nExpected Output: A Python function that reverses the string if its length is greater than 5, otherwise returns the original string.\n"
"\nDescription: Develop a function that takes two arguments, a list of numbers and a target number, and returns a list of indices of the two numbers that add up to the target number.\nExpected Output: A Python function that finds and returns the indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target number.\n"
