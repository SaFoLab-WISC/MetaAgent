DataProcessor :
 The error indicates that the specified file path does not exist. Please verify the file path and ensure that the file is located at the specified location.

If the file path is correct, please provide the correct path so I can proceed with the task.
A case has failed.
Testing completed. 2 cases failed.
=== Step 4: Evolution ===
Let's analyze the reasons for the failures in the provided cases:

1. **File Not Found Error**: The primary issue in both cases is that the specified file paths do not exist. This indicates that the system does not handle file path verification and error handling properly.

2. **Communication Gaps**: The FSM does not have a mechanism to handle errors and retry or request user input for corrections. The system gets stuck when an error occurs.

3. **Redundant States and Agents**: The current system has three agents and multiple states, which might be overcomplicating the task. We can potentially merge some functionalities to reduce the number of agents and states.

### Optimization Strategy

1. **Merge Agents**: Combine the functionalities of `DataProcessor`, `ModelTrainer`, and `Evaluator` into a single agent. This will reduce unnecessary communication and streamline the process.

2. **Error Handling**: Add error handling mechanisms to verify file paths and request user input if the file is not found.

3. **Simplify FSM**: Reduce the number of states by combining related actions into single states. Ensure there is a final state for submission.

### New Multi-Agent System Design

#### Agents

We will have a single agent named `MLAgent` that handles data processing, model training, and evaluation.

#### FSM

We will simplify the FSM to have fewer states, incorporating error handling and user input requests.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Single Agent**: `MLAgent` handles all tasks, reducing communication overhead.
2. **Error Handling**: State 1 verifies the dataset path and requests the correct path if not found.
3. **Simplified FSM**: Four states cover the entire process, with clear transitions and error handling.

This optimized design should address the issues in the failed cases and streamline the process of training and evaluating machine learning models.
