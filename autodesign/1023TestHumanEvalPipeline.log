A case has failed.
Testing completed. 3 cases failed.
=== Step 4: Evolution ===
### Thought Process

1. **Failure Analysis:**
   - The primary failure in the existing system is the lack of a final state transition, causing the system to get stuck in a loop.
   - The communication structure is not optimized, leading to redundant state transitions and unnecessary information exchange.
   - The roles of the agents are somewhat fragmented, leading to inefficiencies in task execution.

2. **Agent Role Positioning:**
   - The current agents are: DescriptionParser, CodeGenerator, CodeValidator, and CodeOptimizer.
   - We can merge the CodeValidator and CodeOptimizer into a single agent to reduce redundancy and streamline the process.
   - The DescriptionParser and CodeGenerator roles are essential and should remain separate to maintain clarity and focus.

3. **Communication Structure Optimization:**
   - The FSM should be simplified to reduce the number of states and transitions.
   - Each state should handle multiple actions where feasible to minimize the number of state transitions.
   - Ensure that the final state is clearly defined and includes the `<|submit|>` instruction.

4. **State Instructions Optimization:**
   - Instructions should be clear, concise, and cover multiple actions where possible.
   - Ensure that each state transition is well-defined and leads to the next logical step in the process.

### New Multi-Agent System Design

#### Agents

1. **DescriptionParser:**
   - **name:** DescriptionParser
   - **system_prompt:** You are DescriptionParser. Your role is to understand and parse the input function description. Extract the requirements, constraints, and any specific details needed for the function. Your responsibility is to provide a clear and structured representation of the function requirements.
   - **tools:** []

2. **CodeGenerator:**
   - **name:** CodeGenerator
   - **system_prompt:** You are CodeGenerator. Your role is to generate Python code based on the parsed requirements provided by DescriptionParser. Ensure the code is syntactically correct and meets the described requirements. Your responsibility is to produce a complete function that adheres to the input description.
   - **tools:** []

3. **CodeValidatorOptimizer:**
   - **name:** CodeValidatorOptimizer
   - **system_prompt:** You are CodeValidatorOptimizer. Your role is to validate and optimize the generated Python code. Ensure the code is syntactically correct, performs as expected, and is optimized for efficiency and readability. Your responsibility is to identify any errors or issues in the code, provide feedback for corrections, and optimize the code without altering its functionality.
   - **tools:** ['code_interpreter', 'search_engine']

#### FSM

1. **States:**
   - **State 1:**
     - **state_id:** 1
     - **agent_id:** 0
     - **instruction:** Parse the input function description and extract requirements.
     - **is_initial:** True
     - **is_final:** False
     - **listener:** [1]

   - **State 2:**
     - **state_id:** 2
     - **agent_id:** 1
     - **instruction:** Generate Python code based on the parsed requirements.
     - **is_initial:** False
     - **is_final:** False
     - **listener:** [2]

   - **State 3:**
     - **state_id:** 3
     - **agent_id:** 2
     - **instruction:** Validate and optimize the generated Python code.
     - **is_initial:** False
     - **is_final:** False
     - **listener:** [2]

   - **State 4:**
     - **state_id:** 4
     - **agent_id:** 2
     - **instruction:** <|submit|>
     - **is_initial:** False
     - **is_final:** True
     - **listener:** []

2. **Transitions:**
   - **Transition 1:**
     - **from_state:** 1
     - **to_state:** 2
     - **condition:** If the function description is parsed successfully

   - **Transition 2:**
     - **from_state:** 2
     - **to_state:** 3
     - **condition:** If the Python code is generated successfully

   - **Transition 3:**
     - **from_state:** 3
     - **to_state:** 4
     - **condition:** If the code is validated and optimized successfully
