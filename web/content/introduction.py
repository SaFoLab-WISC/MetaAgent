## Overview  
![image](/static/images/compare.png)
MetaAgent is a framework that can be used to build your own multi-agent system automatically by **one line of prompt**.  

The Multi-Agent System (MAS) is based on the Finite State Machine (FSM), which is shown in the figure.  

### Auto-generation of Multi-Agent System  
- Given a general task description(eg. Build a multi-agent system for software development), MetaAgent can automatically generate a multi-agent system with several agents.  
- Unlike other auto-generation framework, MetaAgent can generate a multi-agent system without external training data.  
- The generated multi-agent system is also able to solve every cases of the given task domain.   

### Why Finite State Machine?

The finite state machine has several features:   

ðŸ”§ **Tool Enabled**: The agent can use tools to help it complete tasks.  
ðŸ”„ **State Traceback**: The agent can traceback the state of the system when the task fails.
